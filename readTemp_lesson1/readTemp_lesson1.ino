 * Part of series:
 * Introduction to Arduino for Scientists

 * Lesson 1 -  Reading a thermistor 
 * 
 * Many uses of Arduinos in science involve reading one or more sensors and then doing something with the data.
 * Here, we will read a simple sensor - a thermistor - with the Arduino using the analogRead() function.

// This section (outside the setup() and loop() blocks) stores the GLOBAL VARIABLES
// These are variables that are GLOBAL in SCOPE
// Global variables are accessible to any section of the program

// DECLARE a global variable to store the pin number of the pin we will use to read temperature 
// We use an analog pin to read the thermistor
int temperaturePin = A0; .



void setup() {
  // The setup() block is a requirement of ANY Arduino program (even if it is left empty).
  // The setup() block is the first set of commands to run, and the block runs only once, before entering loop()
  

  Serial.begin(9600);  // Open a line to the SERIAL MONITOR at 9600 BAUD rate (bits/second)
}

void loop() {
  // The loop() block is a requirement of ANY Arduino program (even if it is left empty).
  // After the setup() block is run, loop() runs indefinitely.
  
  // DECLARE a LOCAL variable (LOCAL in SCOPE), a variable accessible only to the current function, here loop(). 
  // This variable, of type INT (integer), stores the raw ANALOG value that we read from the thermistor
  // using the function analogRead()
  int temperature_analog = analogRead(temperaturePin);  

  // Here we simply print our data to the Serial Monitor. 
  // Within the Arduino IDE, we can access the Serial Monitor using the square icon on the top right of the window.
  // Note that serial communication uses digital pins 0 and 1, so we can't use them for other things
  // while serial communication is happening between the Arduino and the serial monitor.
  // For command reference, see: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/
  Serial.print("Temperature = ");
  Serial.print(temperature_analog);
  Serial.println();

  // And last, we delay for 500 ms.  Otherwise these commands would execute as fast as the Arduino could possibly run.
  delay(500);
